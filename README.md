# balkonkraftwerk
The purpose of this repository is to control a balcony power plant extended with a battery. 
The focus is on a German regulation with simplified requirements for setups with feed-in below 600W which disclaim feed-in remuneration. 
Therefore, it might be useful to use as much of the energy as possible on your own. 
This setup is made for apartment buildings where the electricity meter is far away from the apartment itself without any option to install a readout device there.
